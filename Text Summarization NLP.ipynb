Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition. The United States is a highly developed country accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the worlds largest economy. PaleoIndians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least  years ago and European colonization began in the th century. In the late th century the US began expanding across North America gradually obtaining new territories sometimes through war frequently displacing Native Americans and admitting new states by  the United States spanned the continent.
